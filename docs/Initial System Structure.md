##  **Initial System Structure**

**Server (Spring Boot REST API)**  
The backend will consist of 3 microservices:

* **Order Service**: Handles orders and routing to pharmacies.  
* **Inventory Service**: Integrates with pharmacy stock levels.  
* **User Service**: Handles authentication and user profiles.

**Client (React Frontend)**

* Interfaces with all backend services.  
* Provides product search, chat with GenAI, checkout flow.

**GenAI Microservice (Python \+ LangChain)**

* Accepts symptom or product queries from the frontend.  
* Uses LangChain with OpenAI API (or local fallback) to suggest OTC medications and offer first-aid advice.

**Database (PostgreSQL)**

* Stores users, orders, pharmacy inventory, and transaction logs.  
* Each Spring Boot service connects to its own schema.

**Communication**

* RESTful APIs between client and server.  
* Internal services may communicate via REST or HTTP calls.  
* GenAI microservice is exposed via REST to server.
